"""
Ito & Matsui (1975) method for computing lateral force on passive piles in slopes.

The method models soil between adjacent piles as being in plastic equilibrium
and provides closed-form equations for the distributed lateral pressure on piles
as a function of depth. The total force per pile is obtained by integrating
the pressure from the ground surface down to the failure surface.
